For compliance with existing applications not using SSL the verifyServerCertificate property is set to 'false'. You need either to explicitly disable SSL by setting useSSL=false, or set useSSL=true and provide truststore for server certificate verification.

For compliance with existing applications not using SSL the verifyServerCertificate property is set to 'false'.
